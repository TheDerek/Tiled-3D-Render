This app uses the tiles you specify in your .tmx file to place blocks
in the 3D scene with the same textures and coordinates. The z coordinate
is found via the tiles layer.

## How to make it work
1. git clone this repo.
2. Use gradle to download the depedencies
3. Replace android/assets/tiled.tmx with your own tiled map (not xml saved)
4. run `gradle desktop run`
5. Complain about my lazziness
